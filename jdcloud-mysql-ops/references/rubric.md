# MySQL Ops Rubric (GCL)

> Concrete instantiation of the **Generator-Critic-Loop** rubric defined in
> `AGENTS.md` §3 for `jdcloud-mysql-ops`. This file is the single source of
> truth for what the Critic scores against.

## Rubric version

`v1` — see `AGENTS.md` §11.

## Dimensions

| # | Dimension | Weight | Threshold | Scale | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Correctness** | hard | ≥ 0.5; **= 1.0 required** for `delete-instance`, `restore-instance`, DDL (`DROP`/`ALTER`/`TRUNCATE`), DML (`DELETE`/`UPDATE` without WHERE) | 0 / 0.5 / 1 | Verifies `instanceId`, region, engine version, instance class, storage GB, and vpc/subnet match the user request. Read back via `describe-instances` and compare. For DDL/DML: read back via `SHOW` and compare row counts. |
| 2 | **Safety** | hard | = 1 | 0 / 1 | Destructive ops (`delete-instance`, `restore-instance`, `DROP TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE`/`UPDATE` without WHERE) MUST have explicit user confirmation captured in trace. For DDL/DML: SQL text MUST appear in the trace verbatim. |
| 3 | **Idempotency** | soft | ≥ 0.5 | 0 / 0.5 / 1 | `create-instance` must use a stable `client-token`; `delete`/`restore` are state-machine-guarded. Score 0 if no idempotency key on a `create` flow. For DDL: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is preferred over `CREATE TABLE`. |
| 4 | **Traceability** | soft | ≥ 0.5 | 0 / 0.5 / 1 | Trace MUST contain: full `jdc` command (or SDK call) or **full SQL text**, args, exit code, raw response excerpt (≤ 2 KB), and final `describe-instances` or `SHOW` snapshot. Score 1 only if all four present. |
| 5 | **Spec Compliance** | soft | ≥ 0.5 | 0 / 0.5 / 1 | Conforms to `core-concepts.md`: engine version supported in region, instance class SKU valid, storage GB within quota, AZ valid, port 3306 (or user-specified). |

## Operation-specific overrides

| Operation | Required dimensions = 1.0 | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `create-instance` | Correctness, Safety, **Idempotency** | Must set `client-token` (UUID v4 if user did not supply one) |
| `describe-instance` / `list` | Correctness, Traceability | Safety & Idempotency are N/A; score 1.0 by default |
| `describe-slow-logs` | Correctness, Traceability | Read-only query; Safety = 1.0 by default. Must validate `startTime` and `endTime` are within 7-day window |
| `describe-slow-logs-by-tags` | Correctness, Traceability, **Spec Compliance** | Composite operation; Safety = 1.0 by default. Must validate: (1) tag_filters format, (2) time window ≤ 7 days, (3) engine filter = MySQL, (4) max_instances respected or user confirmed |
| `analyze-slow-queries` | Correctness, Traceability | Analysis-only operation; Safety = 1.0 by default. Must validate: (1) severity classification rules applied, (2) root cause analysis covers 7 pattern types, (3) optimization advice includes actionable SQL, (4) impact estimation provided |
| `scheduled-slowquery-audit` | Correctness, Traceability, **Spec Compliance** | Composite scheduled operation; Safety = 1.0 by default. Must validate: (1) tag-based instance discovery, (2) cross-instance aggregation, (3) trend comparison vs previous period, (4) top priority extraction |
| `slowquery-alarm-integration` | Correctness, Traceability | Alarm-triggered analysis; Safety = 1.0 by default. Must validate: (1) alarm payload parsing, (2) automatic time window calculation, (3) report generation and delivery |

### Composite operation specific rules (describe-slow-logs-by-tags)

| Check | Rule | Score Impact |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Instance discovery | Must filter by `engine="MySQL"` | Correctness = 0 if non-MySQL instances included |
| Phase 1: Safety guard | If matched > max_instances, MUST have user confirm in trace | Safety = 0 without confirmation |
| Phase 2: Parallel execution | Must use controlled concurrency (max_workers ≤ 5) | Traceability = 0.5 if not documented |
| Phase 3: Aggregation | Must include aggregated_slowlogs sorted by executionTimeSum | Correctness = 0 if missing |
| Trace completeness | Must contain: instance_ids, per-instance counts, errors | Traceability = 0 if incomplete |
| Time validation | startTime/endTime must be valid and ≤ 7 days | Correctness = 0 if invalid |
| `modify-instance` (config: name, password reset) | Correctness, Safety | Hot-apply may cause brief reconnect — flag in trace |
| `modify-instance` (spec: class, storage) | Correctness, Safety, **Spec Compliance** | Storage shrink is **forbidden** — Safety = 0 if shrinking without explicit opt-in |
| `delete-instance` | Correctness, Safety, **Traceability** | Must include pre-delete snapshot (instance id + status + binlog position) |
| `create-backup` | Correctness, Traceability | Backup id must be echoed back in trace |
| `restore-instance` | Correctness, **Safety**, Spec Compliance | `backupId` must be a real, recent backup owned by the same instance; cross-instance restore requires explicit confirm |
| DDL `CREATE TABLE` | Correctness, **Idempotency**, Traceability | Prefer `IF NOT EXISTS`; full DDL must appear in trace |
| DDL `DROP TABLE` / `DROP DATABASE` | Correctness, **Safety**, Traceability | ALWAYS Safety = 0 without explicit `confirm=DROP` in trace → ABORT |
| DDL `ALTER TABLE` (add column / change column) | Correctness, Safety, Traceability | Online DDL preferred; full ALTER must appear in trace |
| DDL `TRUNCATE TABLE` | Correctness, **Safety**, Traceability | ALWAYS Safety = 0 without explicit `confirm=TRUNCATE` in trace → ABORT |
| DML `INSERT` | Correctness, Traceability | Batched `INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...)` preferred over row-by-row; full SQL must appear in trace. For idempotent re-runs prefer `INSERT IGNORE` or `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` |
| DML `UPDATE` | Correctness, **Safety**, Traceability | **MUST have WHERE clause**. Safety = 0 if no WHERE → ABORT |
| DML `DELETE` | Correctness, **Safety**, Traceability | **MUST have WHERE clause**. Safety = 0 if no WHERE → ABORT |
| DML `SELECT` | Correctness, Traceability | Read-only; Safety = 1 by default. **EXCEPTION**: if SELECT text contains `FOR UPDATE`, `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`, `INTO OUTFILE`, or `INTO DUMPFILE` → Safety must be re-scored; missing user confirm → Safety = 0 |

## Safety special cases (auto-fail)

- Delete / restore on an instance tagged `env=prod` **without** an explicit
  `confirm=DELETE` or `confirm=RESTORE` in the trace → **Safety = 0 → ABORT**
- Restore from a backup that belongs to a **different** instance without
  explicit cross-instance confirmation → **Safety = 0 → ABORT**
- Storage shrink (GB decreased) without explicit user opt-in → **Safety = 0 → ABORT**
- `DROP TABLE` / `DROP DATABASE` / `TRUNCATE` without `confirm=DROP` /
  `confirm=TRUNCATE` in trace → **Safety = 0 → ABORT**
- `UPDATE` / `DELETE` SQL text missing a `WHERE` clause → **Safety = 0 → ABORT**
- Any operation targeting an `instanceId` that was not echoed back from a
  `describe-instances` lookup → **Correctness = 0 → ABORT**
- DDL/DML against a `database` or `table` that was not echoed back from a
  `SHOW DATABASES` / `SHOW TABLES` lookup → **Correctness = 0 → ABORT**

## DDL/DML execution path

The `jdc` CLI does **not** currently expose `exec-sql`. DDL/DML is performed
via the SDK low-level `pymysql` / `mysql.connector` path. This is an
**explicitly non-CLI** path:

- Always prefer a read-only pre-check first (e.g., `SHOW TABLES LIKE ...`,
  `SELECT COUNT(*)`) and include the result in the trace.
- Wrap the mutating SQL in a transaction; capture `affected_rows` and
  `warnings`.
- If the SQL is destructive, additionally `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT`
  backup or `mysqldump` (via SDK) the affected table **before** executing.
